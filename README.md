## Dataset Background

#### Dataset

Fuel economy dataset from EPA: https://www.kaggle.com/epa/fuel-economy

#### Content

The purpose of EPA’s fuel economy estimates is to provide a reliable basis for comparing vehicles. Most vehicles in the database (other than plug-in hybrids) have three fuel economy estimates: a “city” estimate that represents urban driving, in which a vehicle is started in the morning (after being parked all night) and driven in stop-and-go traffic; a “highway” estimate that represents a mixture of rural and interstate highway driving in a warmed-up vehicle, typical of longer trips in free-flowing traffic; and a “combined” estimate that represents a combination of city driving (55%) and highway driving (45%). Estimates for all vehicles are based on laboratory testing under standardized conditions to allow for fair comparisons.

The database provides annual fuel cost estimates, rounded to the nearest $50, for each vehicle. The estimates are based on the assumptions that you travel 15,000 miles per year (55% under city driving conditions and 45% under highway conditions) and that fuel costs $2.33/gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, $2.58/gallon for mid-grade unleaded gasoline, and $2.82/gallon for premium.

EPA’s fuel economy values are good estimates of the fuel economy a typical driver will achieve under average driving conditions and provide a good basis to compare one vehicle to another. However, your fuel economy may be slightly higher or lower than EPA’s estimates. Fuel economy varies, sometimes significantly, based on driving conditions, driving style, and other factors.

## Questions & Analysis

We were curious to know how fuel cost has changed over the years as cars have become more effienct but gas prices overall have risen. Our hypthesis about the data were:

1. Average fuel cost has decreased in recent years due to increased car effiency, in this case, miles per gallon. 
2. Standard vehicles are more fuel efficient than performance cars. 
3. Manual drive cars are more fuel efficient than automatic drive cars. 
4. Front, rear, and all wheel drive will have a similar fuel efficiency. 
5. Midgrade gasoline is not a significant factor in average fuel cost and does not have an effect on the overall fuel cost of vehicle. 

### 1. Average fuel cost has decreased in recent years due to increased car effiency, in this case, miles per gallon.  

To explore this hypothesis, we looked at fuel cost and miles per gallon (mpg)  from 1984-2017. We found 

### 2. Standard vehicles are more fuel efficient than performance cars. 

To explore this hypothesis, we comapred fuel cost and miles per gallon (mpg) of Toyotas and Porches from 1984-2017. We found 

### 3. Manual drive cars are more fuel efficient than automatic drive cars. 

To explore this hypothesis, we compared the average fuel cost of automatic cars and manual cars in 2017. We found

### 4. Front, rear, and all wheel drive will have a similar fuel efficiency. 

To explore this hypothesis, we compared the average fuel cost of front, rear, and all wheel drive cars in 2017. We found

### 5. Midgrade gasoline is not a significant factor in average fuel cost and does not have an effect on the overall fuel cost of vehicle. 

To explore this hypothesis, we compared the average fuel cost for cars that used regular, midgrade, and premium in 2017. We found
